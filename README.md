### Validator Testing:
- PEP8 
No errors were returned when passing through the official [PEP8 validator]();

## Bugs:
- In script.js, when I tried to retrieve elements by the class name "day" and access their values, I was relating to them as if they were a single value, which led to an error. 
I later realized that the request was receiving an HTMLCollection, and to access it I needed to iterate through the elements. Using a for loop fixed the issue.

- After adding the notes form I realized that the reservation field (from which select the reservation the note has to refer to) was presenting too many options. The possible reservations weren't just the logged-in user's reservations but all users. Adding a filter to the queryset of the reservation field fixed the problem.

- When writing the function reduce_available_spaces the available_spaces value of the relevant class was reduced temporarily.
When the function was called again, it was starting from the initial value. Simply saving the class fixed the problem.
